# James Daus Portfolio
The code supplied here has been taken from the original projects to include only code by James Daus.

Echo State Networks on IoT and Time Data: This paper was written after a semester of intensive student research on the efficacy of Echo State Network (ESN) architectures on time series data. An entirely handwritten ESN architecture was created and compared against common Scikit-learn and Keras models.

ML Gauntlet (Python): Functions used in my Reservoir Computing research to construct various ML algorithms, KFold test them, and graphically display the results. Additional hyperparameter grid searches were done for optimization.

Wheel of Fortune (C): C code to run a single game of text-based Wheel of Fortune, showing proper and safe use of memory allocation, passing of pointers, and knowledge of data structures. 

FB Analytics Updater (JS): Google Apps Script to fetch and parse Facebook insights JSON then update spreadsheet with contents.
